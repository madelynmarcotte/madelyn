        <h1><b> Music </b></h1>
        <p>I started listening to Weezer because they announced a tour with Green Day and Fall Out Boy. The tickets were very expensive, so my plan was to try and get some when it got closer to the date of the show, which would have been in August. It obviously got postponed to next year, so I’m hoping I might still have a change to get tickets then. </p>
        <p> I also listened to the album that Harry Styles put out in December 2019, and a lot of music that I found on Tik Tok, which is embarrassing. </p>

       <h1> <b> Games</b></h1>
       <p>I got Pokemon Shield for Christmas, and spent a lot of time playing that over Christmas break. I picked it up again once remote learning started up and paid the Nintendo Online subscription so I could complete the Pokedex. I wonder if I will ever stop being like this.</p>
