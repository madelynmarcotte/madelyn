        <h1> <b>Future Plans</b></h1>
        <p>
        <br> I have enrolled at Worcester Polytechnic Institute and I'm hoping to go in the fall, but I don't know what the chances are of that as of right now.</br>
        <br> I am planning on double-majoring in Data Science and Professional Writing, and I'd like to get my masters degree in Data Science in five years.</br>
        <br> This is the first year that Data Science is officially being offered as a major, and it seems like the perfect course of study for me.</br>
        <br> I feel like this plan would set me up well to get a good job after I graduate, but I don't know what kind of job I would want as of right now.</br>
