        <h1><b> Shows</b></h1>
        <p> Meghan and I started watching Parks and Rec at night once remote learning started. As I’m writing this (May 27th, 2020) we just started the last season. I watched Outer Banks and it was corny at times but I enjoyed it. It made me want to hang out with my friends and go to the beach, so hopefully I can do that this summer.</p>

       <h1><b> Movies</b></h1>
       <p> Dad and Meg and I started rewatching Marvel movies, mostly because Meghan has seen almost none of them and I’ve only seen like half of them. At the beginning of remote learning and having to stay home, my mom wanted everyone to pick a movie every few nights, but that didn’t last very long and now we just watch Marvel movies. We watched the Mr. Rogers movie with Tom Hanks per her request. </p>

        <h1> <b> YouTube</b></h1>
        <p> I watch more YouTube videos than I do TV shows. Here are some links to my favorite channels:</p>
